-------------------------------------------

To add a new language, use a copy of '/ideu/lang/ideu_empty.po' and fill all the msgstr "" with the translation.

When done, rename the file with the code of your language after the "_" , like 'ideu_xz.po'.

You may also add the translation of the new language name at end of each .po file (not obligatory).
Example add this at end of of the po files:

msgid "Mylanguage [xz]"
msgstr "MyTranslatedLanguage [xz]"

When your .po file is ready, just add it into '/ideu/lang/' folder.
It will be available via the menu Settings-Language.

The .po file is loaded after each menu Settings-Language so you may change the content of the .po when you want.

Non need to recompile ideU binary.
